# Excel Sample Files

This directory contains sample Excel files that demonstrate the format expected by the BPM Principles Explorer.

## File Structure

Excel files should be structured with:

- The first row containing column headers

## Example

A sample Excel file might have sheets like:
- core_principles
- methodologies
- frameworks

Each sheet would have columns appropriate for that category, such as:
- name
- description
- benefits
- implementation_strategies

## Usage

Upload these Excel files through the web interface to convert them to the JSON format used by the application.
